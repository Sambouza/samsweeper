# samsweeper
### About
A lua command-line based minesweeper clone

### Prerequisites
- Lua interpreter v5.4+ _(older interpreters might still work)_
- The terminal

### Getting started
After installing the lua interpreter on your OS, run by going into the same directory as the lua file and run:
```cmd
lua ./minesweeper.lua
```

### Notes
- Only supports windows cmd formatting.
- Uses io.write("cls") too
